No fun, but good-to-know knowledge.</p><h2 id="framework" tabindex="-1">Framework <a class="header-anchor" href="#framework" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Creating an app from scratch (meaning you write <em>all</em> code yourself) is very hard and very, very time consuming (there&#39;s a lot of code to write). Therefor, some programmers create <em>frameworks</em> other programmers (such as you) can use to more easily create new apps. <em>Bagatell</em> is such a framework.</p><p>So, why use Bagatell to create your apps, and not one of the other frameworks that exist? Truth to be told, Bagatell is a very bad choice for professional apps, such as Spotify, Netflix, Microsoft Word, etc. Instead of being a suitable framework for those type of apps, Bagatell has been designed to be a very good choice and easy to use framework for people that have never programmed before, so they can get started and create small and useful apps by themselves as they learn and become better at programming (most professional frameworks are too hard for beginners to use). But be warned: although Bagatell has been designed to be as easy as possible to use, that does not mean it will be easy; programming is hard \u{1F60E}</p><h2 id="language" tabindex="-1">Language <a class="header-anchor" href="#language" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Bagatell is built on a programming language called <em>JavaScript</em>. Therefore your own Bagatell apps also need to be written in JavaScript, and therefor you need to know/learn JavaScript.</p><p>These tutorials has primarily been designed to teach you how to use Bagatell, but they will also try to teach you the parts of JavaScript you need to know as they are used. But you won&#39;t become an expert JavaScript programmer after having read these tutorials.</p><h2 id="that-s-it" tabindex="-1">That&#39;s it! <a class="header-anchor" href="#that-s-it" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Great work, now you have a basic understanding of what Bagatell is \u{1F973} Next tutorial will be about using pages in Bagatell, which are the fundamental components all Bagatell apps consist of.</p>',10),n=[s];function i(l,h,d,c,u,p){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const f=e(r,[["render",i]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
