Each page has its own Graphical User Interface (GUI), and one page at a time is shown to the user. When the user has interacted with the page (for example clicked on a button in its GUI), the user will come to the next page, and the app will show the GUI of the new page, and so on.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Online Editor</p><p>In our <a href="./../../editor/">Online Editor</a> you can very easily see which pages the app consists of, preview them, as well as see lines between the pages indicating how the user can navigate between them.</p></div><h2 id="creating-a-page" tabindex="-1">Creating a page <a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-page" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>In programming, a <em>class</em> is a description of how a <em>thing</em> should work. The Bagatell framework contains a class called <code>Page</code>, which contains a general description of how a page in Bagatell should work. When you want to create a new page in your Bagatell app, you should create your own class <em>extending</em> the <code>Page</code> class. This way, your own class will already contain the basic functionality a page must contain, and therefor very little work remains for you to do in your own page class!</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Example</p><p>Example showing JavaScript code for how to create your own page class called <code>MyPage</code> (you can name it whatever you want, but all pages in your app must have a unique name).</p><div class="language-js"><button class="copy"></button><span class="lang">js</span><pre><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#C792EA;">class</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#FFCB6B;">MyPage</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#C792EA;">extends</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#FFCB6B;">Page</span><span style="color:#89DDFF;">{</span></span>

You know, sentences in English starts with a capital letter and end with a <code>.</code>, <code>?</code> or <code>!</code>. Just as those rules exists in English, we have rules in programming languages we must follow when writing our code, and this is the code we have to write to create a new class extending the <code>Page</code> class, so there is nothing strange with the code above; that&#39;s simply what we have to write.

You indicate these differences by adding different pre-named <em>methods</em> to your page classes, and then you <em>implement</em> the methods differently in your different page classes.</p><h3 id="tailoring-the-gui" tabindex="-1">Tailoring the GUI <a class="header-anchor" href="#tailoring-the-gui" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>When a page needs to show its GUI to the user, the method <code>createGui()</code> in the page class will be called.
