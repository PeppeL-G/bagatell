# Contact
If you:

* Discover a bug, or
* Have suggestions on improvements (regarding the framework or this website), or
* Need help

Just open an issue in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/PeppeL-G/bagatell/issues). We don't promise we have the time to help you, but it's always good for us to know what is hard to learn when using Bagatell, and what we can do to make it better. Thank you for your feedback ❤️
