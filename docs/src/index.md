# Welcome to Bagatell!
The perfect framework for app beginners.

## What's this?
*Bagatell* is a JavaScript framework one can use to build apps. It has been designed to be very easy to use for beginners at programming, but still with the potential to create quite cool and useful apps in it.

## Why this?
Many people trying to learn programming quickly give up because they think programming is too hard. By instead learning programming through Bagatell, they will hopefully keep on fighting and keep learning more and more about programming since they can create useful apps almost directly from the start.

## Example?
So, what type of apps can be implemented in Bagatell? Well, below you have one example (the example below shows just a preview of an app, when running the app for real it would cover your entire screen).

<ShowApp variousAppName="start-page-examples" />

For more examples, check out the [Examples](./examples/) page. There you can also see the source code for the examples.
