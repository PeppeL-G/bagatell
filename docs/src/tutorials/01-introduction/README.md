# 1. Introduction
This tutorial will teach you what Bagatell is, and some basic information about it. No fun, but good-to-know knowledge.

## Framework
Creating an app from scratch (meaning you write *all* code yourself) is very hard and very, very time consuming (a lot of code to write). Therefor, some programmers create *frameworks* other programmers (such as you) can use to more easily create new apps. *Bagatell* is such a framework.

So, why use Bagatell to create your apps, and not one of the other frameworks that exist? Truth to be told, Bagatell is a very bad choice for professional apps, such as Spotify, Netflix, Microsoft Word, etc. Instead of being a suitable framework for those type of apps, Bagatell has been designed to be a very good choice and easy to use framework for people that have never programmed before, so they can get started and create small and simple apps by themselves as they learn and improve their programming skills (most professional frameworks are too hard for beginners to use). But be warned: although Bagatell has been designed to be as easy as possible to use, that does not mean it will be easy; programming is hard ðŸ˜Ž

## Language
Bagatell is built on a programming language called *JavaScript*. Therefore your own Bagatell apps also need to be written in JavaScript, and therefor you need to know/learn JavaScript.

These tutorials has primarily been designed to teach you how to use Bagatell, but they will also try to teach you the parts of JavaScript you need to know as they are required. But you won't be an expert JavaScript programmer after taking these tutorials.


## That's it!
Great work, now you have a basic understanding of what Bagatell is ðŸ¥³ Next tutorial will be about using pages in Bagatell, which are the fundamental components all Bagatell apps consist of.
